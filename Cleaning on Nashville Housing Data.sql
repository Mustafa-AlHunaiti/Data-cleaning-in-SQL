Property Address could be populated if we had a reference point to base that off
so run this code
Block of code
(
SELECT *
FROM PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
ORDER BY ParcelID 
)
then look at row 44 and row 45 both have the same ParcelID and the same PropertyAddress.
So something that we can do is basically say if this ParcelID(015 14 0 060.00) has an PropertyAddress(3113  MILLIKEN DR, JOELTON) and
this ParcelID(015 14 0 060.00) does not have an PropertyAddress let's populate it with this PropertyAddress(3113  MILLIKEN DR, JOELTON)
that's already populated because we know these are going to be the same
*/
/*
we're going to have to do with this is do a SELF JOIN we have to join the table to itself to look at for example (row 44 and 45) 
if this ParcelID(015 14 0 060.00) is equal to this if this ParcelID(015 14 0 060.00) 
then this PropertyAddress(3113  MILLIKEN DR, JOELTON) needs to be equal to this PropertyAddress(3113  MILLIKEN DR, JOELTON)
